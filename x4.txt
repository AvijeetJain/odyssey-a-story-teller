Mr. Robot is the co-founder and leader of the hacker group fsociety, a revolutionary
prophet who plans to bring down the world's largest conglomerate. Though
he is intelligent
and charismatic, Mr. Robot is also emotionally manipulative, and can be quick to violence. 
This has prompted comparisons to the behavior of militant cult leaders.  

It eventually becomes clear that Mr. Robot is a construct within Elliot Alderson's mind. 
(“eps1.8_m1rr0r1ng.qt”) His persona is an idealized representation of Elliot's deceased father,
 Edward; where Edward was unwilling or unable to take action, Mr. Robot was created to inspire
 war against E Corp and incite historical change. In some situations, Mr. Robot will take control
 and act through Elliot, thus explaining his direct interactions with other people.
